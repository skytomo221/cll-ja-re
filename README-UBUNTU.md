# Compilation

To make all the versions do:

`./cll_build`

The final results will end up under the build/ directory, scattered
about in various places.  If you would like the final outputs only
to be copied to another directory, you can use the -a option, so for example:

`./cll_build -a output/`

would put all the outputs in the output/ directory, whereas

`./cll_build -a ~/public_html/cll_build/`

would put them in your personal webspace.

Running a complete build takes quite a while (like probably at least
an hour).  To do it for just one chapter for faster testing:

`./cll_build -t chapters/05.xml`

This does the whole book but is also much faster:

`./cll_build -t`

There are many possible sub-targets as well, which are specified
with -T, such as:

`./cll_build -t -T pdf`

You can get a complete list of targets via:

`./cll_build -h`
