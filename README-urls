This is about the <anchor.../> tags in the text, which (except for
bits in chapters 20 and 21) are SOLELY A BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
MEASURE.

As such, the <anchor.../> tags should NEVER be updated, even when
things are moved.

The below is how our anchors used to work, and how they map to the
new system, and was originally copied from https://github.com/lojban/cll/issues/82

Old CLL html Chapter 5 Example 2.3 is:

    http://www.lojban.org/publications/reference_grammar/chapter5.html#e2d3

github.io/dag-cll Chapter 5 Example 2.3 is:

    https://lojban.github.io/cll/5/2/#e3

These are both terrible as they rely on the chunking behaviour selected! That is: if the file is one big chunk, neither of these methods can possibly work.

I don't know what that means in terms of our ability to generate such anchors.

Section URLs:

    old: http://www.lojban.org/publications/reference_grammar/chapter5.html#s2
    dag-cll: https://lojban.github.io/cll/5/2/

So the thing is that pre-CLLv1.1 URLs are reliably convertible to CLLv1.1 URLs, just not at the anchor level. In particular, this:

    http://vrici.lojban.org/~rlpowell/media/public/cll_build/cll-xhtml-nochunks/#c5e2d3

is the equivalent of both of the example URLs above, and this:

    http://vrici.lojban.org/~rlpowell/media/public/cll_build/cll-xhtml-nochunks/#c5s2

Notice that these conversions can easily be achieved by Apache mod_rewrite, but there is no sane/obvious way to do it at any other level.

If, for some reason, it is really important to make it so that, say, the chapter-chunked output of CLLv1.1 responds to [url]/chapter5.html#e2d3 , this could be done by:

    1. cp or mv chapter-selbri.html to chapter5.html

    2. Something like: sed -r -i 's;a id="c5e([0-9]+)d([0-9]+)">;&\n;' (untested)

I don't see baking that replacement into the build process as adding significant value, much easier to have whatever system is hosting CLLv1.1's output do it at the mod rewrite level.
