See the "Boring Legalities" section of chapters/01.xml for the
license on the text of the book itself.  It is, as far as I
(rlpowell) can tell, exactly identical to CC-BY-SA (
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ ), which is pretty
awesome of the LLG given that the license was written in 1997 (how
forward-thinking is *that*?).

The contents of the source and all associated scripts and so on
(i.e. this repository) are under the same license as the contents of
the book, except where the content was copied from somewhere else
(i.e. the docbook DTD files and the like).
